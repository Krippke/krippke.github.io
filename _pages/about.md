I'm Manuel Holzrichter, a software developer with over 15 years of professional experience across industry and government projects.

I've worked with a wide range of technologies throughout my career and never limited myself to a single stack. What drives me is curiosity — understanding how things work, why certain approaches succeed, and what makes software teams truly effective.

Over the years, a few themes have become central to how I think about software development:

- **Software architecture** — designing systems with clear boundaries and responsibilities
- **Automated testing** — using tests as the definition of behavior, not an afterthought
- **Developer communication** — bridging the gap between technical teams and stakeholders

This blog is where I share what I've learned along the way. Not textbook theory, but practical insights from real projects — the kind of things I wish someone had told me earlier in my career.
